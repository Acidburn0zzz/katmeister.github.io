## Why precarious labor?
Low wages and job insecurity affected by millions in the USA is slowly being addressed in political and economic change. But it's a slow process because the working poor often do not have the resources to organize, especially because of the digital divide.

>First-person stories have the strongest effect on bringing attention to the wealth disparity.

Public participation and organization is crucial to closing the wage gap and improving benefits for workers in fast food, retail, domestic, agricultural, and transportation sectors. Sharing personal, moving stories is proven to be a strong way to encourage activism and create positive social impact.

## Hackathon Hatched
I participated in a hackathon held by UC Davis professors Glenda and Jesse Drew with the theme: "Social media for insecure labor." We aimed to develop a way to connect precarious workers in America based off Jesse's research.

Jesse told us of situations where farmworkers mass texted each other tip-offs whenever illegal immigrant deporters may have raided farms. Using this primitive, yet effective, communication as our starting point, we considered the importance of social media in connecting workers and allowing them to tell their stories.

### Pre-Hack User Research
In order to understand our potential users and create personas, we each interviewed a few labor group organizers about how technology fits into their workflow.

### The Results
After a coffee-fuled night, we presented an anonymous story-sharing platform for precarious workers to post any kind of work-related narrative.

The prototype and concept was well-recieved. Not too long after, a few team members started developing the research idea into an actual product. We met with labor organizations, potential funders, data visualization researchers, developers, and design firms to bring our idea to realization.

## Go to the people!
We took a beta of the app to AFL-CIO, a national labor convention, and talked to both precarious workers and labor organizers. They told us their stories and let us post them on the map and feed.

Many people stopped by our testing booth via word of mouth. Everyone has a story to tell and is eager to share, as long as it's convenient and quick to do so. We were surprised to find that a lot of users didn't mind using their real names.
