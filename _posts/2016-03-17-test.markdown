After wrapping up my design fellowship at [Sequoia](http://www.sequoiacap.com) during December of 2015, I was able to start off 2016 by stepping back and focusing on myself. With my free time, I tried a few things out...

* Attempted baking
* Fixed up my portfolio
* Wrote my first [Medium post](https://medium.com/@katfukui/the-design-portfolio-workflow-a94030d0b39e)
* Practiced my Javascript on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com)
* Consistent exercise

Pretty fun and productive stuff, right?
