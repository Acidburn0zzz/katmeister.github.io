After wrapping up my design fellowship at [Sequoia](http://www.sequoiacap.com) during December of 2015, I was able to start off 2016 by stepping back and focusing on myself. With my free time, I tried a few things out...

* Attempted baking 🍰
* Fixed up my portfolio 💻
* Wrote my first [Medium post](https://medium.com/@katfukui/the-design-portfolio-workflow-a94030d0b39e) 📝
* Practiced my Javascript on [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com) ✊
* Exercised consistently 🏃

Pretty fun and productive stuff, right? And of course, the one looming checkbox on my To Do list...

* Find my dream career opportunity that reflects my goals and encourages growth. A place where people care about the shit I care about. Where I can become a better coder. Where I can do impactful work.

## Octocats
I feel super honored and happy to say that I've just joined the [GitHub](http://www.github.com) design team as a Product Designer.
