## My Role
I joined the Everlaw team as its first designer, ready to establish a product design process. What sets Everlaw apart from other products in the law technology realm is its focus on building the fastest, easiest to use software on the market. I wanted to make sure this goal was apparent in the aesthetics, user flows, and overall experience of using the product.

### Design Leader
I integrated user experience and research into the product creation process and lead design efforts, including a complete product redesign, visual rebranding, and mobile optimization.

### Flow Check
I went through the entire platform to make user flow and experience enhancements. For any new features, I made sure they fit in and made sense with the existing flow. I used either pen/paper wireframes or high-fidelity prototypes to convey my ideas.

### Overall Scrappy Go-Getter
As the only designer, if I wanted something done, I took the initiative to make it happen!

## The Challenge
I was brought on to solve Everlaw's original problem of a non-existent brand presence and outdated UI. But, parts of the product UX were clunky, and some features didn't feel fully developed. It was clear this wouldn't be just a reskinning problem.

Thankfully, being at a small startup, I had the freedom to reframe the problem. With help from the team, I laid out the conceptual foundation first by asking, **What is Everlaw's <u>story</u>? What makes us different and better than familiar, safe choices?**

I felt knowing this would establish the brand direction, as well as figure out where the product is headed. After researching with the product team, we established that our high-level challenge was:

> Speed up the tedious data reviewing process by creating focused and personalized experiences centered around their work, starting with the product's Homepage.

This goal served as guidance for bringing Everlaw on its way to becoming a robust ediscovery product.

## User and Market Research
I researched the current market by learning about the ediscovery process from my law-educated colleagues and talking to early adopters of the product. These are the insights I gained about our userbase—

### Not Their Choice
Law firms are the ones who pick which ediscovery product their employees use. The actual users doing the review work often don't have a say in their software. <mark>Thoughts: Empower this group to speak up and convince case leads to switch over permanently.</mark>

### Not All Data is Equal
Everlaw's hosted cases range from 1GB of data to 1TB. Average users of the 1TB case will probably have more data to keep track of than the former.<mark>Thoughts: The new homepage must still be easy and quick to sort through for data-intense cases.</mark>

### Tunnel Vision Workflow
When users log back into the product, they resume their work from where they last left off.

### Balancing Act
The reviewers' end goal is to craft a narrative to take to court. We should allow them to keep track of their thoughts and create

### Speed > Everything
Users just want to do things quickly. They're browsing through hundreds of pages a day to cull relevant information and need unobtrusive design.

## Adding Hierarchy
The Homepage is where users land when they first log in and resume their work. All data and some review features live here. The problem with the original design was a lack of hierarchy or sense of priority, so I began my Homepage redesign by mapping out the incoming content.

![Homepage Flow](/assets/everlaw-hpmap.png)

### Tabs and Tables
Based on analytics and feedback, most users resume their work where they last left off in a Search, Binder, or Assignment.

My initial thoughts were to prioritize personal content because it would be most relevant to their work (Searches they've done, Arguments they've created). I decided to try keeping only the most recent Searches and Assigned Binders on the main page in table form so you could take action on the first 4 items at once and scroll if need be.

![Homepage Flow](/assets/everlaw-idea1.jpg)

The above first iteration has three tabs—Recent content, StoryBuilder, and Tasks. Tabbed out further in 'My Searches' are Recent and Favorites. Yikes, pretty tab-heavy. It also includes personal review stats in the form of cards, such as 'Documents reviewed today' and 'Total review time' to show users their progress.

### Don't assume behaviors
My goal here was to chunk out the features by most frequently used, and show the most recent items of each feature. But, this doesn't work because I incorrectly assumed that all users most frequently use Searches and Binders. Upon analyzing the data, some users don't use Searches at all. Others are deep into StoryBuilder, which is tabbed out. Also, what is defined as 'Recent' in the table? At what point is content 'not recent'? Scrapped!

## But maybe those cards are okay...
After scrapping the first iteration, we found that the cards intended for personal review stats might be our content-separating solution. It chunks out each piece of data so it's easier to comprehend and interact with than a line in a table. We can color-code them by Category with a top-border. We can sort and organize them quickly. We can stack them. The team was instantly hooked.

### Everything is a card!
For the next iteration, I turned every piece of content into a card, placed them in color-coded categories, and created a dashboard at the top with personal review stats and most recent cards. I thought by showing the most recent item of each category, it would allow users to access the last thing they worked on and still let them see all the features.

### Clicking to reveal is tedious
But, the sidescrolling carats proved to be frustrating to navigate, especially if you need to access the last of 50 cards in a category. We considered showing two rows of cards in each category that also horizontal scroll, but the act of clicking through is tedious. We also thought about an infinite 'Load More' that reveals more rows, but realized that would vertically bloat the page and possibly push the other categories into oblivion.

While there is hierarchy amongst the categories (Searches are above Binders, etc), there isn't much within them. Cards within each category are still displayed in a row that isn't conducive for 'tunnel vision' workflows.

## Sidebar Nav

![Sidebar Nav](/assets/everlaw-idea3.jpg)

I disliked the previous layout because there's no set place for "Favorited" items to live, which is a feature we aimed to push since our users tend to work on one card at a time. I tried a sidebar navigation homepage that defaults to the most recent cards you've accessed, with a tab dedicated to Favorites.

### Too many clicks deep
While the sidebar approach looks much cleaner, the Search, Binders, and StoryBuilder features are still pushed a few clicks down. This lag can make all the difference when a user has a piece of the story fresh in their mind and needs to access a card layers in. I also tried defaulting to Favorites, but that still posed the same issues.

## Make 'Favorites' the star
So, it was clear we needed balance between focusing in on the most recent card and quickly accessing other cards and features when inspiration calls. After playing around with prototypes for days that the devs created, we found that your most recent cards will not be your resuming point in your workflow.

>Most recent 	&#8800; Most important

With this in mind, we decided that the Favorites function needs to be at the top of the hierarchy. Recent cards and all cards are steps lower, and all Features should be easily accessible no matter what you're doing in the homepage.

An Everlaw colleague suggested turning the first all-cards layout on its side to achieve this. As silly as it sounded, I tried it and it fit quite well with our updated Hierarchy Map. We used this as the basis for the final product. No idea is too weird or 'stupid' to try!

## Micro and Macro
By putting cards in vertical columns, Favorites is easily accessible at the most-left. You get a **micro view** by interacting with the most recent cards at the top of each column, and a **macro view** where you can reach all cards across all categories quickly.

### Persistent Filter
Because the amount of cards on each homepage varies, we added a persistent filter box to quickly find any card. The devs made sure this part was snappy and fast. This gif is in real-time:

### Expanded View
To accommodate long columns of cards, we conceived an "expanded view" that hides other columns and alphabetizes the cards. This is helpful for Admins who often keep track of dozens of Binders and Assignments cards.

In the end, we took out the personal review stats because it took up too much vertical real estate. I originally wanted stats for personalization, but focusing on user's content is even more valuable and personal.

## In Retrospect
I learned a lot about shipping a product that affects every single one of your users and can positively impact their work.

### Beginner's Mind
When I first began working, I was afraid that I would insult our users by designing without having a law background. But because I didn't have any biases on what a law product should behave and look, I worked extra hard on user research.

### Really understand your user
See how the product fits into your user's workflow. What are all access points back into the product?

### Don't compromise speed
What good are pretty transitions and Dribbble-worthy UI if the product is too slow? This should apply to all product design, not just data-complex ones.
