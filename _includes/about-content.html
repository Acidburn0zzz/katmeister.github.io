		<h2>Hi, I'm Kat—</h2>
		<p>a product designer from California. I want to build things that are empowering and important to people. I'm often thinking about design's increasing role in tech + the world, and how to keep improving.</p>

		<p>Just finished up a fellowship making cool stuff in a tiny, but inspiring design lab at <a href="http://www.sequoiacap.com">Sequoia Capital</a>. Now, I'm looking for my next endeavor!</p>

I spend too much time spoiling my cats Momo, Aki, and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/mishka5ever" target="_blank">Mishka</a>. If you or a loved one also suffer from CLS, my support group meets every Caturday.</p>
